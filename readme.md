Small program I made using MARS 4.5, that converts Farenheit to Celcius temperatures for the purpose of sharping my skills in assembly Mips and testing Mips capabilities. Warning software is still highly unstable and still needs some more polishing before it can accurately describe a farenheit temperature which cant be represented by a integer.

Warning: Dont trust this software calculations until further notice.
